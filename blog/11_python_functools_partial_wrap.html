<p>﻿# Python functools wraps and partial</p>

<p>Official documenation is <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html">here</a></p>

<h2>partial</h2>

<p>partial is just like the C++ bind mechanism, it is used to degrade the order of function.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function </p>

<p>that takes multiple arguments (or a tuple of arguments) into evaluating a sequence of functions, </p>

<p>each with a single argument (partial application). </p>

<p>It was introduced by Moses Schönfinkel and later developed by Haskell Curry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">Wikipedia: Currying</a></p>

<p>also notice the great figure behind the currying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Haskell Brooks Curry (/ˈhæskəl ˈkɜri/; September 12, 1900 – September 1, 1982) was an American mathematician and logician. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There are three programming languages named after him, Haskell, Brooks and Curry, as well as the concept of currying, </p>

<p>a technique used for transforming functions in mathematics and computer science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry">Wikipedia: Haskell Curry</a></p>

<p>In my own words, currying is just turns a function with multiple paramters </p>

<p>into a series of functions with just one parameter (maybe combined with an function parameter).</p>

<h2>wraps</h2>

<p>wrapper provide a mechanism for decorating functions with modifying their prototypes.</p>

<p>It is very useful for documentation.</p>

<p>Let's see an example:</p>

<pre><code>        from functools import wraps



        def my_decorator(func):

            @wraps(func)

            def wrapper(*args, **kwds):

                print "invoking ", func.__name__, "(", args, ", ", kwds, " )"

                print func.__doc__

                return func(*args, **kwds)

            return wrapper



        @my_decorator

        def example(name, **properties):

            '''This is used for documentation.'''

            print "This is the demo function"



        example("Daniel King", gender="Male", company="Keen")
</code></pre>

<p>and result is:</p>

<pre><code>        invoking  example ( ('Daniel King',) ,  {'gender': 'Male', 'company': 'Keen'}  )

        This is used for documentation.

        This is the demo function
</code></pre>
