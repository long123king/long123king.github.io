blog

This is the main entrance of my coming blogs.

I have got this idea while I am posting a blog to cnblogs site, where my previous blogs resides.
You may know, the cnblogs is not so ideal for hosting a blog site.

But cnblogs provide a great function to backup all blogs to a xml file.
so my oppotunity comes, I can write a script to extract all my previous blogs and commit them all 
to the GitHub, my ideal place to host my blog.

Because I like use the **markdown** to write, and the GitHub support it very well.

All I need to do is write some Homepage or something, to provide entry for all my blogs(You guess right, 
all the blogs are written in markdown).

[Markdown Mode Extension for VisualStudio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0855e23e-4c4c-4c82-8b39-24ab5c5a7f79) is very suitable for this task.
