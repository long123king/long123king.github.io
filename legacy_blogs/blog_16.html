<body><blockquote>
<h1><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff556757(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">Storage Volumes</a></h1>
<p>A <em>volume</em> is a storage device, such as a fixed disk, floppy disk, or CD-ROM, that is formatted to store directories and files. A large volume can be divided into more than one <em>logical volume</em>, also called a <em>partition</em>. Each logical volume is formatted for use by a particular media-based file system, such as NTFS, FAT, or CDFS.</p>
<p>A <em>storage volume</em>, or <em>storage device object</em>, is a device object &minus; usually a physical device object (PDO) &minus; that represents a logical volume to the system. The storage device object resides in the storage device stack, but it is not necessarily the topmost device object in the stack.</p>
<p>When a file system is mounted on a storage volume, it creates a file system volume device object (VDO) to represent the volume to the file system. The file system VDO is mounted on the storage device object by means of a shared object called a <em>volume parameter block</em> (VPB).</p>
<h3>Mount Manager</h3>
<p>The <em>Mount Manager</em> is the part of the I/O system that is responsible for managing storage volume information such as volume names, drive letters, and volume mount points. When a new storage volume is added to the system, the Mount Manager is notified of its arrival in either of the following ways:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The class driver that created the storage volume calls <strong>IoRegisterDeviceInterface</strong> to register a new interface in the MOUNTDEV_MOUNTED_DEVICE_GUID interface class. When this happens, the Plug and Play device interface notification mechanism alerts the Mount Manager of the volume's arrival in the system.</li>
<li>The driver for the storage volume sends the Mount Manager an IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request, specifying IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_ARRIVAL_NOTIFICATION for the I/O control code. This request can be created by calling <strong>IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unique Volume Name</h3>
<p>The Mount Manager responds to the arrival of a new storage volume by querying the volume driver for the following information:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The volume's nonpersistent device object name (or target name), located in the <strong>Device</strong> directory of the system object tree (for example: "\Device\HarddiskVolume1")</li>
<li>The volume's globally unique identifier (GUID), also called the <em>unique volume name</em></li>
<li>A suggested persistent symbolic link name for the volume, such as a drive letter (for example, "\DosDevices\D:")</li>
</ul>

<p>Windows操作系统对于mount的操作，管理得比Linux严格。</p>
<p>当一个新的存储设备(Storage Volume)注册到Mount Manager后，会在Device目录下创建一个临时的名称，比如\Device\HarddiskVolume1;&nbsp;</p>
<p>这个Volume的GUID是它的唯一标识；</p>
<p>此外，该设备会在\DosDevices\C:处理创建一个符号链接。</p>
<p>这就是各个盘符的由来，它们只不过是到\Device\HarddiskVolume1的符号链接而已，而\Device\HarddiskVolume1也并不是这个Storage Volume的固定名称，而只是这次启动临时赋予的名称，可能下次启动时就变成了\Device\HarddiskVolume2。</p>
