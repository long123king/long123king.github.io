[Intel Pin](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool) is a very ***COOL*** framework to work with. 

It can instrument target application at instruction, basic block, trace, routine and image level.

```
int a = 10;
while( a-- >= 0)
   printf("I loves Intel Pin!");
```
